Great question 👍 Let’s go step by step and explain **Otsu’s Binarization** and how it applies to the picture you shared.

## 🔹 What is Otsu’s Binarization?

Otsu’s method is an **automatic image thresholding technique**. Instead of manually picking a threshold value (say 127), Otsu’s algorithm finds the **optimal threshold** by analyzing the **image histogram**.

* In a grayscale image, pixel values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
* The histogram shows how many pixels fall into each intensity value.
* Otsu’s method tries to **separate foreground (object) and background** by choosing a threshold that **minimizes the variance within each group** (foreground & background) or equivalently **maximizes the variance between groups**.

This makes it especially useful for images with **bimodal histograms** (two peaks — one for background and one for foreground).

## 🔹 Steps of Otsu’s Method

1. **Compute histogram** of grayscale image.
2. **For each threshold (t)** (from 0 to 255):

   * Divide pixels into two groups:

     * Group 1: intensity ≤ t  
     * Group 2: intensity > t  

   * Calculate **within-class variance** (how spread out values are inside each group).  
   * Track which threshold gives the **lowest within-class variance** (or highest between-class variance).  

3. **Select that threshold** as the Otsu threshold.  
4. **Apply binary thresholding** → pixels ≤ threshold become black (0), others become white (255).

## 🔹 Explaining the Picture You Shared

Looking at your image:

1. **Left side (Original Image)**  
   * A grayscale photo of a building with sky in the background.

2. **Middle (Histogram with regions highlighted)**  
   * The histogram shows the distribution of pixel intensities.  
   * Three highlighted ranges:  
     * **0–169 (red box)** → darker pixels (building details, shadows).  
     * **170–214 (blue box)** → middle tones (windows, walls).  
     * **215–255 (yellow box)** → bright pixels (sky, reflections).  

3. **Right side (Binary Images for different ranges)**  
   * **Top (0–169):** Highlights darker regions (building edges, roof).  
   * **Middle (170–214):** Highlights mid-gray areas (walls, structure).  
   * **Bottom (215–255):** Highlights bright regions (sky and bright reflections).  

👉 These three binary outputs illustrate how thresholding separates different intensity ranges.

## 🔹 Otsu’s Role Here

Instead of us **manually picking thresholds (like 169 or 214)**, Otsu’s method **automatically finds the best threshold** by analyzing the histogram.

* If the histogram has two main peaks (dark building vs. bright sky), Otsu’s method picks a threshold value **between them** (likely around 170–180).  
* This ensures **clear separation**:  
  * Building → Black (foreground)  
  * Sky → White (background)  

Thus, Otsu’s binarization is a **data-driven, automatic way** of achieving what is shown on the right side.

✅ **In summary**:  
Otsu’s Binarization finds the threshold that best separates foreground (building) and background (sky). In your image:  
* The histogram shows multiple intensity clusters.  
* The binary maps on the right illustrate thresholding effects.  
* Otsu automatically chooses the "best cut" to maximize contrast between object and background.
